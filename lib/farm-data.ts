Continue alternating brown and green layers\n\n6. Keep the pile as moist as a wrung-out sponge\n\n7. Turn the pile every few weeks to aerate it\n\n8. The pile should heat up as decomposition occurs\n\n9. Compost is ready when it's dark, crumbly, and earthy-smelling (usually 3-12 months)\n\nMaintain a ratio of roughly 3 parts brown to 1 part green materials for optimal decomposition.",

Peas and beans (though they'll produce less than in full sun)\n\n6. Fruits - currants, gooseberries, raspberries, blackberries\n\nThese plants will grow more slowly and produce less than they would in full sun, but can still provide a good harvest.

For dry seeds (beans, peas, corn, lettuce):\n   - Allow to fully mature and dry on the plant\n   - Harvest when pods or seed heads are completely dry\n   - Remove seeds and dry further indoors if needed\n\n3. For wet seeds (tomatoes, cucumbers, melons):\n   - Choose fully ripe fruits\n   - Scoop out seeds with pulp\n   - Ferment in water for 2-3 days to remove gel coating\n   - Rinse and dry thoroughly\n\n4. Store dried seeds in paper envelopes or glass jars\n\n5. Keep in a cool, dry, dark place\n\n6. Label with variety name and date\n\n7. Most seeds remain viable for 2-5 years if stored properly",

Look for their dark droppings on leaves and the ground\n\n3. If you see hornworms with white rice-like protrusions, leave them be - these are parasitic wasp cocoons that will help control the population\n\n4. Apply Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) spray, which is organic and specifically targets caterpillars\n\n5. Encourage natural predators like birds, predatory wasps, and ladybugs\n\n6. Till soil in fall and spring to destroy overwintering pupae\n\n7. Practice crop rotation\n\n8. Plant companion plants like basil, marigold, and borage to repel or confuse the adult moths",

Home test kits - Reasonably accurate, available at garden centers\n\n3. Digital pH meters - Quick results but need proper calibration\n\n4. DIY vinegar and baking soda test (less accurate):\n   - Mix soil with distilled water\n   - Add vinegar - if it fizzes, soil is alkaline (pH > 7)\n   - Or add baking soda - if it fizzes, soil is acidic (pH < 7)\n\nTo adjust pH:\n\n1. To lower pH (make more acidic):\n   - Add sulfur, aluminum sulfate, or acidic organic matter like pine needles\n\n2. To raise pH (make more alkaline):\n   - Add limestone, wood ash, or dolomite lime\n\n3. Make gradual adjustments over time, not all at once\n\nMost vegetables prefer a slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0).",

Choose appropriate containers:\n   - At least 12 inches deep for most vegetables\n   - Larger is better - 5 gallons minimum for tomatoes, peppers, eggplants\n   - Ensure drainage holes\n\n2. Use high-quality potting mix, not garden soil\n\n3. Best vegetables for containers:\n   - Tomatoes (determinate varieties)\n   - Peppers and chilis\n   - Lettuce and greens\n   - Herbs\n   - Bush beans\n   - Radishes\n   - Carrots (in deep containers)\n\n4. Watering is critical:\n   - Check daily in hot weather\n   - Water when top inch of soil is dry\n   - Apply until water runs from drainage holes\n\n5. Fertilize regularly:\n   - Use liquid fertilizer every 2-3 weeks\n   - Or slow-release fertilizer according to package directions\n\n6. Place in appropriate light:\n   - Most vegetables need 6+ hours of sun\n   - Consider mobility for moving containers to follow sun\n\n7. Consider vertical supports for vining plants",
